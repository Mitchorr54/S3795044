								<p><b>Name:</b> Mitchell Orr <br>
<b>Student Number: </b>s3795044<br>
<b>E-mail address: </b>mitchorr54@gmail.com<br>
<b>Background: </b>I grew up in country NSW and have lived in different states, I currently live in Alice Springs NT and work for the federal government<br>
<b>Nationality: </b>Australian<br>
<b>Languages: </b>English<br>
<b>Education:</b><br>  
		2009 - Year 12 HSC NSW<br>
		2010 - 2014 - Electrical Apprenticeship<br>
	  	2019 - Commenced Bachelor of IT<br>
<b>Interesting fact:</b> I enjoy riding unicycles!<br></p><hr>

<p><b> Where my interest in IT stems from & my experience:</b><br>
My interest in IT started at a young age, I have always been the go-to person to solve a myriad of technical issues, I fell in love with fault finding issues and loved taking on the challenge of repairing families PCs. This lead to me building my own PC at age 15 by saving up money from different jobs I was working, I currently have no IT experience but I did complete an electrical apprenticeship & working in this field allowed me to work with PLC's and SCADA systems, working with these systems strengthened my interest in IT.</p><hr>

<p><b>Why I came to RMIT:</b><br>
I chose to come to RMIT/OUA because it offers me the flexibility I require to be able to successfully study, I work Monday to Friday and have no time to be able to attend on-campus study, also living in Alice Springs means I cannot study on campus anyway. The other important factor is that I work on remote Indigenous communities meaning there are often times where mobile coverage and internet coverage are zero (as I am typing this I have no internet on a community) so the flexibility of being able to do the work on weekends is exactly what I need.</p><hr>

<p><b>What I expect to learn:</b><br>
I mainly want to learn how to program, but I am finding all the different ideas that have been presented to me in the intro to IT course very interesting, I am very interested in the theory behind IT. My aim is to work overseas and I want to learn as much as I can to enable that to come to fruition. </p>

							<p><b>Link to my ideal IT job:</b><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38532675?tracking=TMC-SAU-eDM-SharedJob-13246"> HERE</a><br>

<p><b>Description & why the role interests me: </b><br>
This role is a high-level software engineer responsible for the development of cybersecurity systems, the advertisement doesn't explicitly say who the employer is but it does mention they are a global leader in their field.  The role will require the engineer to develop new functionality for their existing cybersecurity systems.


<br> <br>I find this role appealing as the job requirements are extreme and the idea that someone out there has the capacity to fulfil this role excites me. I have only just started on my journey of learning to program and have just dipped my toe in the water of the whole IT world and can see the long journey ahead of me, but to reach this pinnacle would be an achievement in itself. Programming in itself interests me most due to its fault finding aspect, I appreciate the eureka moments of sorting out code in a logical way.<br><br>

<b>Skills required for the role:</b> <br>
The job requirements for this role are immense but I believe they are obtainable with effort. The position requires a lot of programming experience with particular reference to compiled languages and scripted languages. There is also an element of being able to test products with this role and having knowledge and experience with this is advantageous. Experience with working in the agile framework is also required.<br><br>
<b>Skills that I have in relation to the role:</b><br>
I currently have little to no skills which match this job role but I always believe in setting goals and this job to me perfectly suits where I would like to be in 10-12 years time. I have only just commenced learning to code and have only the basics of Java so far, also have a small amount of use with git thanks to this project.<br><br>
<b>Plans to achieve these skills:</b><br>
I will strive to gain these skills during my studies as well as after my study is complete. My goal after I have finished studying is to become a digital nomad, I am looking to try and find a job where I can work remotely from anywhere in the world. One piece of work that suits this would be software development. Starting out by practising with my coding and then looking to take on freelance work and continuing to refine my coding skills would be my starting point for gaining skills in software development. As I currently work for the federal government my department is an adopter of the agile software development framework this means my department has a lot of information and opportunities to work in the agile environment, the department also offers opportunities to job shadow to gain these unique skills.

								<h2 class="major">My test results</h2>
								
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/test1.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>Figure 1. Results of Myers-Briggs test</h4><br>
								<h3>Myers-Briggs test results:</h3>
								<p>For this first test result, I got the ESTP-A personality or the entrepreneur personality type. I believe this is accurate especially with the emphasis on extroversion. I think as this personality type has an emphasis on the social side of life that I make a good all-rounder in a team although I do recognise the weaknesses that I bring to a team such as insensitivity, impatientness and being unstructured.<br>

With the recognition of my personality type comes the sense we need to try and find a balance between strengths and weaknesses of individuals to form a well-functioning team. My weakness could be someone else's strength, the big challenge is getting people to recognise their strengths and act upon them.</P><hr>
							
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/test2.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>Figure 2. Results of Learning style test</h4><br>
								<h3>Learning style test results:</h3>
								<p>The second test result saw me getting the result of being mostly a tactile learner, meaning that I'm usually hands-on when learning something new, I agree with this result. I have definitely found within my life that I usually need to be tinkering or working with something to correctly learn or develop a solution to something. This result would influence me to ensure that I continue to recognise this as my learning preference, I want to continue to put an emphasis when in a team environment to recognise other people's learning styles.<br> 
In an ideal world, it would be great to match all people in a team with the same learning styles to try and create an efficient team as possible, but this isn't realistic and we need to find the right balance between learning styles and take their individual learning needs into account.</P><hr>
							
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/test3.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>Figure 3. Big five personality test</h4><br>
								<h3>Big five personality test results:</h3>
								<p>My third test that was completed was a big five personality test, the results showed also put an emphasis on extraversion, this just reinforces that personality trait for me. The thing I found peculiar with this was the next result of emotional stability.<br> I think this fits in well with a team and potentially give me the ability to be a diplomat of sorts to try and resolve conflict within a team environment.
 I think all teams need someone in them who is level headed and emotionally stable to promote stability, level-headedness and logic.

							<h2 class="major">My Project idea</h2>

								<p><b>Overview:</b><br>
The idea in which I have come up with and that I am passionate about is to develop a smartphone app, I want this app to be targeted towards Indigenous communities. The idea is to promote connectivity and inclusiveness between communities and to also promote the solidification of Indigenous language in a written format to preserve and promote the individual languages for future generations. <br><br>
<b>Motivation:</b><br>
My motivation behind the app is to create a social enterprise, one that has a particular focus on the recruitment and the use of Indigenous people to develop, manage and promote the app. Whilst the app will be useful, my main focus would be to work on promoting and increasing computer literacy and creating jobs on remote Indigenous communities. I have chosen an app as this will allow a lower cost entry point to use the app over a computer and it's known 'just 6 per cent of residents in some remote Indigenous communities even have a computer' (Tugwell 2011, No guarantee, para. 2).<br><br>

<b>Description:</b><br>
Currently, in the majority of the Indigenous communities in which I work the use of older technology is common. An example is the use of fax machines to distribute important community notifications to other communities, such as funeral notifications or community closure notices. If these notices are missed by the receiving communities this could result for example in a person not participating in Sorry Business which is an extremely important cultural event for some Aboriginal communities. <br><br>
My idea involves the updating of this protocol by allowing community notifications to be provided in a digital format instantaneously and to notify the end user with a push notification. A further benefit to this idea is that it doesn't only allow for communities and community members to access this vital information it will also allow for community stakeholders who may not be present on the community to receive these notifications and allow for them to remain up to date with what is happening. For example, with my job, we are required to travel to remote communities via vehicle this could require us driving 2+ days from Alice Springs to reach a community, usually prior to departure we need to contact the community to ensure that it is safe for us to visit the community, ensuring there is no cultural business happening or that the community isn't closed to outsiders. With the app, we could feel somewhat confident that we have access to up to date information on our travels ensuring we don’t encroach on sensitive community business.<br><br>
Further to my idea above, I want to develop the app so that the end user can select the language in which they want the app to be displayed with the main focus being that the app can be displayed in an Indigenous language. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (2016), there are about 150 Native languages spoken.<br>
Whilst the community notification aspect of the project is the current main idea, with the project being a social enterprise, I would propose that the app would develop over the course of its life to incorporate different elements and would hope to see the further development ideas come from the consultation with end users and communities to advocate for the changes they want to the app.<br><br>
<b>Issues that could arise:</b><br>
-	Indigenous languages are complex and some of the languages have no written form, this means that whilst some Indigenous people can speak their language they may be unable to read it.<br>
-	Cultural sensitivities need to be taken into account, for example with Indigenous funerals and in some Aboriginal communities mentioning a deceased person's first name is culturally insensitive.<br>
-	Indigenous recruitment can be complex and a lot of upskilling to achieve the indigenous recruitment goal is going to take time to achieve.<br><br>
<b>Tools required:</b><br>
I would aim to develop the application for use initially on Android devices this means I would aim to develop the program using the Java programming language.<br>
Software required for development:<br>
-	Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java: Eclipse IDE<br>
-	Windows operating system <br>
Hardware required for development:<br>
-	Laptop or desktop PC<br>
-	Android device for testing developed product<br><br>
<b>Skills required:</b><br>
Some of the skills that I have identified for the development of the product are:<br>
-	In-depth knowledge of Java programming to develop software for product<br>
-	Knowledge of how an Indigenous community works<br>
-	Indigenous language subject matter experts<br>
-	Indigenous cultural awareness<br>
-	Knowledge of product testing<br>
-	Marketing skills<br>
I currently only possess 2 of the skills identified and would need to draw on information that I could source online and around me, I do also note that with the language side of the app there are numerous indigenous language apps on the market in which information could potentially be drawn upon.<br><br>
<b>Outcome</b><br>
The outcome of the development of this app could be considered profound, I think that by looking forward to the future and realising that IT is the way forward. This can lead to empowerment and development of the most disadvantaged Australians, the other aspect I like about this idea is that it can offer the community members that develop the necessary IT skills to be able to work from their home community and remain attached to their country and keep their sense of identity whilst also being a productive member of their identity as a whole. <br><br>
